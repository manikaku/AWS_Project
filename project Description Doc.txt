Project Highlight: Secure RDS Integration with AWS Instances
===============================


Project-1 : 

--> if you dont have custom vpc as we discussed, create one. (8 Subnets, 2 Pub/web, 2 app/private, 2 db/private, 2 lambda)

--> launch a Windows JUMP Server in your custom VPC public subnet and use this to connect to Private Subnet resources.

--> launch a NAT Instance, as we need to install packages in our private subnet ec2 instance.

1. Launch an ec2 instance (Launch Amazon Linux 2) for web server in CustomVPC APP private Subnet
2. Launch rds cluster in CustomVPC DB private Subnet
3. Configure ec2 instance to connect to rds (Take care about the security groups).

--> Connect to APP Server.. 

yum install httpd -y
service httpd start
chkconfig httpd on


--> Install mysql client

sudo yum install -y mysql

Export mysql endpoint with below command.
export MYSQL_HOST=<your-endpoint>

export MYSQL_HOST=demoname.cfpgnjehw330.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com

###export MYSQL_HOST=project.cegsujor6xa6.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com


--
--> Connect to mysql to create a db user

mysql -h demoname.cfpgnjehw330.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com -P 3306 -u dbadmin -p

###mysql -h project.cegsujor6xa6.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com -P 3306 -u dbadmin -p


--

--> CREATE DATABASE mywebapp;

CREATE TABLE mywebapp.customers (
    id INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

CREATE USER 'webappuser' IDENTIFIED BY 'mani1234';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON mywebapp.* TO webappuser;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Exit

--
--> Install required dependencies:

sudo amazon-linux-extras install -y lamp-mariadb10.2-php7.2 php7.2

service httpd restartc

--

cd /var/www/html/

'vim info.php' and write below code/command to "info.php" file, save and close

<?php phpinfo(); ?>

Open browser in your jump server and enter "APP-Server-INSTANCE-IP/info.php", this should display all php config information.

--

Now create an "index.html" below shared file/ below code.

Refer the shared "index.html" and copy content and paste it here. 


----

--> Also, create another file name "submit.php" and paste the below content.

Refer the shared "index.html" and copy content and paste it here. 

** Replace 'rds-hostname', 'username', 'password', 'database'.

---------


Now create an Application Load Balancer in your custom VPC Public SUbnets and add your private APP Server to this load balancer's target group.

Now access http://<your-elb-dns>/ , Fill the required information and submit. Data should store in mysql mywebapp.customer database.

connect to RDS Database and execute below sql query to view all information you submitted from the webpage you created.


mysql -h wordpress.cfpgnjehw330.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com -P 3306 -u admin -p

mysql -h project.cegsujor6xa6.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com -P 3306 -u admin -p

SELECT * from mywebapp.customers;
